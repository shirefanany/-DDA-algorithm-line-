#DDA-algorithm-line-
small game using  DDA algorithm by C# 
Here is my code  implement DDA algorithm without using drawLine method in c#
first you have to use mouse and draw rectangle 
then press space or enter and watch 
started from x=0,y=0 a small pic will move on the line toward the rectangle you have just draw
thats all , ihave used dda algorithm to move the small pictures on the line
